# TV_Script_Generation--Udacity

Deep learning Course Project 3 : Build a neural network to generate the next scene in a TV script. Using recurrent neural networks.

### Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

### Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public [GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch), in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using: git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git
This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

### Submission
The [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2260/view) contains a checklist for steps to build this network.

### Advanced Projects
After completing this project, try applying what you learned to one of these problems.
